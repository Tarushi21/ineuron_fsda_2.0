Recently, I learned of Verisk for the Data Scientist role and I was compelled to contact you with my interest. I believe that my professional background and industrialist drive make me an ideal candidate for this opportunity.  While working as a Java developer in my past role company, I was fascinated by the Data Scientist role of in helping organizations shorten replenishment and lead times, automate demand forecasting, lower inventories, and improve on-time production and delivery, and this marked the onset of my interest in Data Scientist role.  I possess excellent knowledge of professional software engineering practices &  have followed best practices for the full SDLC, including coding standards, code reviews, source control management, build processes,testing, and operations with good understanding of SQL along with good data visualization techniques in Excel & Tableau both.  You may notice a gap in my employment while reviewing my resume. During this period, I elected to take a leave from the workforce in order to go back to home and take care of my sick father for an year. This situation further got aggravated as I was diagonised with severe neurological issues which leads to dizziness and inattentiveness. Once I recovered , I  worked hard to upgrade my professional skills required for the role by undergoing Data Science certification program from Purdue University to re-enter the work force.  The time that I was able to commit to my education has been invaluable to my professional growth, and I am eager to re-enter the professional sphere and apply my newfound qualifications and knowledge to the job. I have enclosed my resume for your review. I will try and contact you within the week to discuss the next steps in your hiring process.

Recently, I learned of the opening for the Data Scientist role and I was compelled to contact you with my interest. I believe that my professional background and industrialist drive make me an ideal candidate for this opportunity.  While working as a Java developer in my past role company, I was fascinated by the Data Scientist role of in helping organizations shorten replenishment and lead times, automate demand forecasting, lower inventories, and improve on-time production and delivery, and this marked the onset of my interest in Data Scientist role.  I possess excellent knowledge of professional software engineering practices &  have followed best practices for the full SDLC, including coding standards, code reviews, source control management, build processes,testing, and operations with good understanding of SQL along with good data visualization techniques in Excel & Tableau both.  You may notice a gap in my employment while reviewing my resume. During this period, I elected to take a leave from the workforce in order to go back to home and take care of my sick father for an year. This situation further got aggravated as I was diagonised with severe neurological issues which leads to dizziness and inattentiveness. Once I recovered , I  worked hard to upgrade my professional skills required for the role by undergoing Data Science certification program from Purdue University to re-enter the work force.  The time that I was able to commit to my education has been invaluable to my professional growth, and I am eager to re-enter the professional sphere and apply my newfound qualifications and knowledge to the job. I will try and contact you within the week to discuss the next steps in your hiring process. I appreciate your time and consideration of my candidacy for your new Data Scientist role.

Recently, I learned of HIKE opening for the Business Analyst role and I was compelled to contact you with my interest. I believe that my professional background and industrialist drive make me an ideal candidate for this opportunity.  While working as a Java developer in my past role company, I was fascinated by the Business Analyst role of in helping organizations shorten replenishment and lead times, automate demand forecasting, lower inventories, and improve on-time production and delivery, and this marked the onset of my interest in Business Analyst role.  I possess excellent knowledge of professional software engineering practices &  have followed best practices for the full SDLC, including coding standards, code reviews, source control management, build processes,testing, and operations with good understanding of SQL along with good data visualization techniques in Excel & Tableau both.  You may notice a gap in my employment while reviewing my resume. During this period, I elected to take a leave from the workforce in order to go back to home and take care of my sick father for an year. This situation further got aggravated as I was diagonised with severe neurological issues which leads to dizziness and inattentiveness. Once I recovered , I  worked hard to upgrade my professional skills required for the role by undergoing Data Science certification program from Purdue University to re-enter the work force.  The time that I was able to commit to my education has been invaluable to my professional growth, and I am eager to re-enter the professional sphere and apply my newfound qualifications and knowledge to the job. I have enclosed my resume for your review. I will try and contact you within the week to discuss the next steps in your hiring process. I appreciate your time and consideration of my candidacy for your new Business Analyst role.
