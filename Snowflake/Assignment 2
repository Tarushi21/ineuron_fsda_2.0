--1. Load the given dataset into snowflake with a primary key to Order Date column.

CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE TS_SALES
   (
     ORDER_ID VARCHAR(20),
     ORDER_DATE DATE PRIMARY KEY, 
     SHIP_DATE DATE,
     SHIP_MODE VARCHAR(15),
     CUSTOMER_NAME VARCHAR2(70),
     SEGMENT VARCHAR(15),
     STATE VARCHAR(70),
     COUNTRY VARCHAR(35),
     MARKET VARCHAR(7),
     REGION VARCHAR(15),
     PRODUCT_ID VARCHAR(20),
     CATEGORY VARCHAR(16),
     SUB_CATEGORY VARCHAR(15),
     PRODUCT_NAME VARCHAR(200),
     SALES INT,
     QUANTITY INT,
     DISCOUNT NUMBER(3,3),
     PROFIT DECIMAL,
     SHIPPING_COST NUMBER(10,2),
     ORDER_PRIORITY VARCHAR(8),
     YEAR STRING);
     
DESCRIBE TABLE TS_SALES;

SELECT * FROM TS_SALES;


---2. Change the Primary key to Order Id Column.

     ----DROP PRIMARY KEY
     
ALTER TABLE TS_SALES DROP PRIMARY KEY;
     
---ADD PRIMARY KEY
     
 ALTER TABLE TS_SALES ADD PRIMARY KEY(ORDER_ID);
 
 ----4. Create a new column called order_extract and extract the number after the last ‘–‘from Order ID column.
 
 SELECT*, SUBSTRING(ORDER_ID, '9') as order_extract FROM TS_SALES;
 
 --5. Create a new column called Discount Flag and categorize it based on discount. Use ‘Yes’ if the discount is greater than zero else ‘No’.
 
 SELECT *, 
     CASE
         WHEN DISCOUNT> 0 THEN 'YES'
         ELSE 'NO'
     END AS Discount_Flag 
FROM TS_SALES;
     
     
---6. Create a new column called process days and calculate how many days it takes for each order id to process from the order to its shipment.

SELECT *,  DATEDIFF('DAY', ORDER_DATE, SHIP_DATE) AS PROCESS_DAYS FROM TS_SALES;

/*7. Create a new column called Rating and then based on the Process dates give
rating like given below.
a. If process days less than or equal to 3days then rating should be 5
b. If process days are greater than 3 and less than or equal to 6 then rating
should be 4
c. If process days are greater than 6 and less than or equal to 10 then rating
should be 3
d. If process days are greater than 10 then the rating should be 2.*/

SELECT *, DATEDIFF('DAY', ORDER_DATE, SHIP_DATE) AS PROCESS_DAYS, 
   CASE
       WHEN PROCESS_DAYS <=3 THEN '5'
       WHEN PROCESS_DAYS<=6 AND PROCESS_DAYS >3 THEN '4'
       WHEN PROCESS_DAYS <10 AND PROCESS_DAYS>6 THEN '3'
       ELSE '2'
    END AS RATING
FROM TS_SALES;
